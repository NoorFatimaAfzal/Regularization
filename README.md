## Introduction

This repository is designed to help you understand the concepts of bias and variance, and how different methods can be used to balance them. It also covers the specifics of regularization techniques, which are essential tools in machine learning for preventing overfitting and improving model performance.

## Bias-Variance Trade-Off

Understanding the bias-variance trade-off is crucial for developing effective machine learning models. Here, we explain the concepts of bias and variance and how to find a balance between the two.

## Methods to Address Bias-Variance Trade-Off

Several techniques can help manage the bias-variance trade-off:

- [Bagging](./Methods/Bagging/bagging.md): A method to reduce variance by combining the predictions of multiple models.
- [Boosting](./Methods/Boosting/boosting.md): A method to reduce bias by sequentially improving the performance of weak models.
- [Regularization](./Methods/Regularization/regularization.md): A technique to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty for large coefficients.

## Regularization Techniques

Regularization is a key method for addressing overfitting in machine learning models. We cover three main types:

- [Ridge Regression](./RegularizationTechniques/Ridge/explanation.md): Uses L2 penalty to shrink coefficients.
- [Lasso Regression](./RegularizationTechniques/Lasso/explanation.md): Uses L1 penalty to set some coefficients to zero, performing feature selection.
- [Elastic Net](./RegularizationTechniques/ElasticNet/explanation.md): Combines L1 and L2 penalties to balance between Ridge and Lasso.

## Conclusion

In the conclusion, we summarize the key points and discuss when to use each method to achieve the best results in your machine learning projects.

We hope you find this repository helpful for understanding and applying regularization techniques in your machine learning models. Happy learning!
